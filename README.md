# TSP-D_Solutions
These files provide numerical solutions to a set of benchmark instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D) that were originally published by Bouman et al. (2018), according to a generation scheme described in Agatz et al. (2018). The numerical results are the solutions yielded by a variable neighborhood search heuristic introduced in El-Adle et al. (2021). 

The files are organized as follows: Following the name of each instance, the number of nodes is specified, then the objective value. Provably optimal solutions are denoted with an asterisk.
